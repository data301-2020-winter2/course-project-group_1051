## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{The dataset is provided by Airbnb, and it was collected by the website Insideairbnb.com. The data is about Airbnb rental information in New York City. It includes the user ID, name, host ID, neighborhood, location, room type, price, number of reviews, last review, reviews per month, minimum night and availability. There are 48896 rows and 16 columns of data in total. It was collected from 2011-03 to 2019-07. The purpose of this dataset is for business analysis. The relation between neighborhood, price, room type, number of reviews, host listings count, and availability can be studied. It can also be used to predict the rental price based on other variables, which could help a host to make more profit. The data was automatically collected by Airbnb Platform and Payment Services. Geo-location information such as precise or approximate location was collected from user’s IP address or mobile device’s GPS. The limitation of the dataset is that no customer stay-duration, guest review score, nearby tourist attraction or safety level available.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{I hope to analyze the correlation matrix to find out which factors are closely related. I would also like to build a predict model for the price of the rentals based on the data provided. Questions like which area is the most/least popular, which room type is the most/least common and the rental rate ranking of the areas could be explored.  If possible, I would like to design a recommend system which can recommend a few hosts for the traveler based on his/her preference. I am interested in this dataset because I am a big fan of Airbnb and NYC is one of my dream destinations, but it is also quite expensive. This dataset provides an overall feeling about accommodations in New York City. The information like average cost for each room type and area with the best rental rate could help travelers like me to choose a suitable accommodation. I speculate that room type column and neighborhood column must be related to the price column because better living experience certainly costs more. 
Building a user facing Dashboard is feasible because there are plenty of variables could be shown on a dashboard, and the data visualization on the map of NYC would be a fascinating feature.
